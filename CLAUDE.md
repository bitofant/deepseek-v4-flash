# DeepSeek V4 Flash
Purpose of this repo is to run a quantized version of DeekSeek V4 Flash 0731 using `llama.cpp` in docker.

Serves an OpenAI-compatible API on **port 8000** as a drop-in replacement for the vLLM service.

## Machine
- headless machine running Ubuntu Server
- 96gb system memory - not all of it is available (~91gb total, ~81gb available)
- RTX 5090 with 32gb VRAM - **shared, not exclusive**: `vllm_gemma4-31b-nvfp4-mtp` normally owns
  all of it (`--gpu-memory-utilization 0.982`, `restart: unless-stopped`). One GPU LLM at a time.
  `start.sh` stops vLLM, `stop.sh` restores it.
- docker and nvidia docker tools already installed
- Ryzen 9 9900X (12C/24T), driver 610.43.02 / CUDA 13.3, GPU is Blackwell **sm_120**
- Crucial T705 Gen5 NVMe, ~670gb free

No custom Dockerfile: upstream's `.devops/cuda.Dockerfile` already does what we need, driven by
`--build-arg CUDA_VERSION` / `CUDA_DOCKER_ARCH`. If a patch ever becomes necessary, add
`<file>.patched.<ext>` here plus a thin Dockerfile that `COPY`s it over the submodule — never edit
`llama.cpp/` in place.

Image tags per build: `deepseek-v4-flash:b<N>`, `:<upstream-describe>`, `:latest`.
`build.number` bumps only on success.

## Model
`unsloth/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-GGUF`, quant **UD-IQ3_XXS** (104gb, 4 shards).
284B total / 13B active MoE, 43 layers, 256 routed experts (6 active), 1M ctx max.

**Routed experts are ~97.5% of the weights** (~277B of 284B); the dense part is only ~6.5B. So the
dense layers + KV cache go on the GPU and the experts are split GPU/RAM with `--n-cpu-moe`.

Fit: 81gb RAM + 32gb VRAM = 113gb usable > 104gb.
- GPU: ~8gb dense + ~4gb KV + ~0.6gb overhead → ~19gb of experts
- experts ≈ 96gb / 43 layers ≈ 2.23gb per layer → ~8 expert layers fit on GPU
- `--n-cpu-moe 35` leaves ~78gb of experts in RAM vs ~85gb free. **Headroom is ~7gb — tight.**

Measured 2026-08-04 at `N_CPU_MOE=36`, `-ub 2048`: **23-24 tok/s decode**, **310 / 715 / 808 tok/s
prefill** at 0.6k / 4.6k / 18k-token prompts. For reference a DGX Spark managed 15.5-17.4 tok/s decode
/ 148 tok/s prompt on a comparable quant. Expect a slower first request after each start — mmap pages
the weights in from NVMe lazily (the server reports healthy in ~16s, long before the weights are
resident).

### Prefill is PCIe-bound, not CPU-bound
llama.cpp's op-offload streams the RAM-resident expert weights to the GPU **once per ubatch** (measured
7-16 GB/s sustained PCIe rx during prefill, ~26gb per 512-token ubatch). The cost is per-ubatch and
fixed, so it amortises over ubatch size — this is the single biggest lever in the whole setup.
Raising `N_CPU_MOE` by one buys the VRAM headroom that makes the big ubatch pay off.

`./tune.sh` sweeps flags and `./bench.sh` measures; measured 2026-08-04, prefill tok/s by prompt size:
| `-ncmoe` / `-ub` | 0.6k | 4.6k | 18k | decode | VRAM |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 35 / 512 (old default) | 172 | 325 | 332 | 22 | 25.6gb |
| 35 / 2048 | 236 | 592 | 759 | 22 | 26.1gb |
| **36 / 2048 (current)** | **310** | **715** | **808** | **23-24** | **24.2gb** |
| 36 / 3072 | 223 | 696 | 903 | 21 | — |
| 36 / 4096 | 224 | 666 | 925 | 22 | — |
| 34 / 2048 | 210 | 579 | 711 | 21 | — |

**2.4x prefill at long context for free.** `-ub` above 2048 keeps helping at 16k+ but regresses at
≤4k, so 2048 is the best all-round pick for agent traffic. Decode depends only on `-ncmoe` (bytes read
from RAM per token), not on `-ub`; the ±1 tok/s spread between same-`-ncmoe` rows is run noise.

Verified at `-ub 2048`: a 3-needle recall test over a 6.5k-token prompt (4 ubatches) returns all three
needles, so the upstream `ubatch >= 32` KV-corruption report does not reproduce here.

### Decode is near its ceiling — don't expect much
Decode reads ~1.9gb/token of expert weights from RAM (36 layers x 6 of 256 experts). At 23.5 tok/s
that is ~44 GB/s effective against a 96 GB/s theoretical / ~60-70 GB/s practical dual-channel ceiling.
RAM is already at its rated 6000 MT/s (2x48gb CMK96GX5M2B6000Z30), so there is no BIOS win. The only
real lever left is reading fewer bytes: fall back to `UD-IQ2_M` (90.9gb, ~12% fewer bytes) via
`QUANT`/`MODEL_FILE` in `download-model.sh` + `start.sh`, at a quality cost.

**Speculative decoding is a loss here — do not enable it.** Measured 2026-08-04 on an echo-the-file
prompt: `--spec-type` off 23 tok/s, `ngram-mod` 21, `ngram-map-k` 18. With experts in RAM, verifying K
draft tokens routes to up to 6K distinct experts and so costs ~Kx the weight reads, which outweighs
any acceptance gain. `draft-mtp` is unavailable regardless: the Unsloth GGUF ships no `nextn`/MTP
tensors (no `deepseek4.nextn_layer_count` key).

mmap stays enabled (the default) so RAM overflow degrades to NVMe paging instead of OOM. Do not add
`--mlock` or `--no-mmap`.

### Models live in `~/models/gguf`, NOT the HF cache
vLLM bind-mounts `~/.cache/huggingface` and pulls by repo id, but `~/scripts/hf-cache-cleanup.sh`
builds its KEEP set by grepping `MODEL_ID=` out of `~/scripts/vllm.sh` and `rm -rf`s everything else
under `hub/`. A GGUF there would be treated as an orphan and deleted. Keeping it at `~/models/gguf`
(the path `~/scripts/llama.sh` already declares) avoids that, and llama.cpp wants a plain file path
anyway rather than the hub's blobs/snapshots symlink layout.

## Flag choices worth remembering
- **f16 KV cache** (no `--cache-type-k/-v`): upstream reports garbage output with quantized KV on this
  architecture. Deliberate deviation from `~/scripts/llama.sh`'s `q8_0` default.
- `--jinja`: required for V4's chat template / tool calling.
- `--restart no`: vLLM's container is `unless-stopped` and also binds 8000 — two auto-restarting
  containers would race for the port after a reboot.
- `--threads 12`: physical cores only; SMT siblings thrash cache.
- Health start period is generous — loading 104gb takes minutes.
- `-b/-ub 2048`: see the prefill tuning table above. Not a default — the default `-ub 512` costs 2.4x
  prefill at long context.
- `start.sh` always recreates the container: the flags are baked in at create time, so reusing a
  stale one would silently ignore edits to the constants.
- Upstream (PR #24162, merged 2026-06-29) had post-merge reports of KV corruption at `ubatch >= 32`
  *with expert offloading*. Did not reproduce at `-ub 2048` (see needle test above).

## Agent config sync
`start.sh` calls `~/scripts/update-agent-models.sh` (same as vllm.sh / colibri) to point pi + OpenClaw
at whatever :8000 serves. Two llama.cpp-specific details:
- `--alias` is what makes `/v1/models` report `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731`; without it the id is the raw
  container path of the GGUF, which is what would land in the agent configs.
- That script reads the context window from vLLM's `max_model_len`, **which llama.cpp does not report**.
  It would silently fall back to its own 32768 default, so `start.sh` passes `CONTEXT_WINDOW` explicitly.
  Change `CONTEXT_SIZE` in `start.sh` and both agents follow; verified end-to-end at 40960.

## Ports
8000 = this service / vLLM (mutually exclusive). 8080 = open-webui, do not use. owui already has
`http://host.docker.internal:8000/v1` registered, so it picks this up with no config change.

## Usage
```
./build-async.sh start && ./build-async.sh wait
./download-model.sh
./start.sh
./stop.sh
```

## CLAUDE.md Guidance
- broad architecture of this repo must be recorded in `CLAUDE.md`
- file must be kept in sync with the repo, apply edits to `CLAUDE.md` alongside changes to the repo
- use terse language

## Work Guidance
- scripts are argument-free and configured by the `# --- configuration ---` constants at the top
  - do NOT use env variables to tune our scripts — edit the constant, so there is nothing to memorize
- skip code comments if the code is self-explanatory
- code comments must be extremely terse
- less code is better code
- create and persist small scripts instead of running medium to long bash commands ad-hoc
  - e.g. create `start.sh`, `stop.sh`, `rebuild.sh`, ...
- do not install anything globally
  - example: if a 1-time dependency is required to download a model from hugging-face, just write a script to create and start a throw-away container to get it done
- prefer additive patches over editing
  - example: instead of cloning a repo and applying changes in place, prefer cloning a repo in a subfolder, and "override" files from the subfolder via Dockerfile instructions at build time
